                    Branch
                </p>
                <p>

                    Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's
                    can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In Git, branches are a part of your
                    everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
                    When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new
                    branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the
                    main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into
                    the main branch.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Merge
                </p>
                <p>

                    Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent
                    use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. The following examples in this document will
                    focus on this branch merging pattern. In these scenarios, git merge takes two commit pointers,
                    usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common
                    base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge
                    commit sequence.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Say we have a new branch feature that is based off the main branch. We now want to merge this
                    feature branch into main.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Invoking this command will merge the specified branch feature into the current branch, we'll assume
                    main. Git will determine the merge algorithm automatically.
                </p>

                    Commit
                </p>
                <p>

                    The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed
                    snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you
                    explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, the git add command is used to promote
                    or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. These two commands git commit and
                    git add are two of the most frequently used.

                    Tags
                </p>
                <p>

                    Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a
                    point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a branch
                    that doesn’t change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.
                    For more info on branches visit the git branch page. This document will cover the different kind of
                    tags, how to create tags, listing all tags, deleting tags, sharing tags, and more.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Creating a tag
                </p>
                <p>

                    To create a new tag execute the following command: git tag
                    <tagname>
                </p>
                <p>

                    Listing Tags
                </p>
                <p>

                    To list stored tags in a repo execute the following: git tag
                </p>
                <p>

                    Sharing: Pushing Tags to Remote
                </p>
                <p>

                    Sharing tags is similar to pushing branches. By default, git push will not push tags. Tags have to
                    be explicitly passed to git push.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Checking Out Tags
                </p>
                <p>

                    You can view the state of a repo at a tag by using the git checkout command.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Deleting Tags
                </p>
                <p>

                    Deleting tags is a straightforward operation. Passing the -d option and a tag identifier to git tag
                    will delete the identified tag.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Repositories
                </p>
                <p>

                    Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various versions of a Project. These files are
                    imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updates and modifications
                    in the content of the file. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to create these versions and
                    store them in a specific place termed as a repository. The process of copying the content from an
                    existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed as cloning. Once the cloning
                    process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by default assumes
                    the work to be done on the repository is as a user once the cloning is done.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. To delete a repository, the
                    simpler way is to just delete the folder containing the repository.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Git allows the users to perform operations on the Repositories by cloning them on the local machine.
                    This will result in the creation of various copies of the project. These copies are stored on the
                    local machine and hence, the users will not be able to sync their changes with other developers. To
                    overcome this problem, Git allows performing syncing of these local repositories with the remote
                    repositories.
