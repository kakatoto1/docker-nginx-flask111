                What is Docker?
            </p>
            <p>

                Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver
                software in packages called containers.[6] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software
                that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.
            </p>
            <p>

                Container
            </p>
            <p>

                A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the
                application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container
                image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to
                run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
            </p>
            <p>

                Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become
                containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications,
                containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate
                software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance
                between development and staging.
            </p>
            <p>

                Images
            </p>
            <p>

                A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of
                instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point
                when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.
            </p>
            <p>

                Docker is used to create, run and deploy applications in containers. A Docker image contains application
                code, libraries, tools, dependencies, and other files needed to make an application run. When a user
                runs an image, it can become one of many instances of a container.
            </p>
            <p>

                Docker images can be created through either an interactive or Dockerfile method.
            </p>
            <p>

                Interactive method
            </p>
            <p>

                With this method, users run a container from an existing Docker image and manually make any needed
                changes to the environment before saving the image. The interactive method is the easiest way to create
                docker images. The first step is to launch Docker and open a terminal session. Then use the Docker run
                command image_name:tag_name. This starts a shell session with the container that was launched from the
                image. If the tag name is omitted, Docker uses the most recent version of the image. After this, the
                image should appear listed in results.
            </p>
            <p>

                Dockerfile method
            </p>
            <p>

                This approach requires making a plain text Dockerfile. The Dockerfile makes the specifications for
                creating an image. This process is more difficult and time-consuming, but it does well in continuous
                delivery environments. The method includes creating the Dockerfile and adding the commands needed for
                the image. Once the Dockerfile is started, the user sets up a .dockerignore file to exclude any files
                not needed for the final build. The .dockerignore file is in the root directory. Next, the Docker build
                command is used to create a Docker image and an image name and tag are set. Lastly, the Docker images
                command is used to see the created image.
            </p>
            <p>

                Repositories
            </p>
            <p>

                Docker Hub repositories allow you share container images with your team, customers, or the Docker
                community at large.
            </p>
            <p>

                Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub through the docker push command. A single Docker Hub repository
                can hold many Docker images (stored as tags).
            </p>
            <p>

                To create a repository, sign into Docker Hub, click on Repositories then Create Repository
            </p>
            <p>

                When creating a new repository: You can choose to put it in your Docker ID namespace, or in any
                organization where you are an owner.
            </p>
            <p>

                Pushing a Docker container image to Docker Hub
            </p>
            <p>

                To push an image to Docker Hub, you must first name your local image using your Docker Hub username and
                the repository name that you created through Docker Hub on the web.
            </p>
            <p>

                You can add multiple images to a repository by adding a specific :
                <tag> to them (for example docs/base:testing). If it’s not specified, the tag defaults to latest.
            </p>
